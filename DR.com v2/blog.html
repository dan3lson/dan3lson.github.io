						It's official - going to be in Boston for 10 weeks starting mid-May.
						Read on to learn why.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Some of you know that I left my corporate job on the last day of September 2014
						to pursue my education technology startup (Leksi) full-time. Part of that reason
						was because I needed to learn how to actually develop the beta version and give
						it some real life. Though my background is in Information Systems from CMU,
						programming isn't my forte. In fact, I essentially failed their intro programming
						course and had to retake it again in order to take the more advanced course that
						was required for my major.
					</p>

					<p>
						Now that almost six months have passed, I've made decent progress on
						the product development side when it comes to the frontend pieces to
						Leksi (i.e. HTML & CSS (which I already knew) and JavaScript (which
						I learned), but not as much as I had hoped on the backend (Ruby on
						Rails)). There's a ton of tutorials out there, but as opposed to the
						frontend code that I've written, I wouldn't be able to recreate it
						all from scratch without anyone's help and understanding of what I'm
						doing and why things work. With that said, below are three main
						things I hope to gain by attending the web development bootcamp in
						Boston, Launch Academy:
					</p>

					<p>
						<ol>
							<li>Create awesome projects from scratch and understand how Rails
									works / comes together</li>
							<li>Be able to build upon the existing version of Leksi and
									iterate it further after pilots, user-testing, etc</li>
							<li>Help others learn to code and complete slices of their projects</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>
						I recently Tweeted that #codeEqualsPower. It's an amazing feeling
						to know that I can either work for a Facebook or create the next
						Facebook. I know Launch Academy will help get me to that point and
						am very excited for it. As a born-and-raised New Yorker from the
						Bronx (Yankess, Giants, Knicks all the way), dare I say it'll be
						n....i...c..........e living in Boston for a while? Hmmm...we'll
						see.

				In my last post, I talked about the excitement of becoming an entrepreneur at the beginning of this year and why I decided to pursue my idea. In the first of three parts in this series, I'll briefly expand on that (so that this and future posts make more sense) and then work my way backwards with how I got started with initially researching competitors, sharing the idea with friends and family, and arriving at my first entrepreneurship book.

						During Winter Break when I was a sophomore at Carnegie Mellon, I finally had time to read something
						that didn't come from a textbook or wasn't required by one of my classes. I realized more matter-of-
						factly that as I was reading, there were a number of words I didn't know. Being who I am, I wanted to
						define them so that I could:

						<ul>
							<li>Know what they meant</li>
							<li>understand their immediate context and ensure I didn't miss the bigger picture</li>
							<li>Learn them well enough to use it in my writing and when talking to others</li>
							<li>Not be frustrated when encountering and still not knowing that word in the future </li>
						</ul>
					<p>
						My solution to this problem was simple - I created an excel spreadsheet with two columns - "Name"
						and "Definition". Soon I had a growing list of words, which was cool because I thought I was actually
						learning them by just writing them down somewhere. I realized though that I really wasn't learning
						for a number of reasons. Then Winter Break ended, spring semester started, and it became really
						cumbersome to maintain and try to learn those words with everything else going on.
					</o>

					<p>
						Fast forward to a few days before this past New Year, I found myself in the exact same situation. I was
						reading a Forbes article and saw words I didn't really know. I thought to myself, "Didn't
						you see this before? I'm pretty sure I looked it up. Grr...I should know this by now!" And then it hit
						me - there must be many people out there that feel the same as I do in some way. With that all said, I
						decided I'd create an app to truly help build one's vocabulary naturally and consequently build
						their reading comprehension and communication skills in a proven way that's engaging, fun, and social.

			    <div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			      <div class="panel-body">
						<p>Surely someone out there already thought of and created what my idea is, right? I searched all of the app stores and found thousands of results related to "vocabulary". Thousands! Damn, I had a lot of research ahead of me, I thought. That search was too broad so I decided the next three searches were going to be against key differentiators.

						<h4>Personal Dictionary</h4>
						THe results were significantly narrowed down after searching for "personal dictionary". Ah, much better! After reading the description and looking into each, some didn't even apply despite what they were called so the list was shortened even further. Out of the ones that remained, <i>what</i> I wanted to do regarding the creation of personal word-lists existed to some degree and <i>how</i> I wanted to implement it was no where to be found. I took that as a somewhat comforting sign, but what was more telling was what I found in the reviews: people wanted to actually create their personal dictionaries (and not be forced to download or have huge lists of words they're not interested in or will rarely encounter). There wasn't one app that met and exceeded their expectations; perfect, I thought: I shall deliver for you all on this <i>build</i> aspect, and that's just part of the overall apps meaning / strategy!
						</p>
						<p>
							<h4>Learning New Words</h4>
							The next competitive-research I needed to do was on how apps taught vocabulary. I didn't just want to save and build a list of my own words, I wanted to actually learn them by recognizing, understanding, and using them at any point in the future. First, there was no narrowing down this list with all of the software programs, mobile apps, online apps, and traditional means of instruction, e.g. that exist today. Second, on one end of the spectrum there are claims of teaching words, but their methods of instruction are subjective and effectiveness is ambiguous. On the other end of the spectrum, others are based on spatial learning and adaptive-learning. Still, I wanted to learn words in ways that were backed by research and was wrapped in a truly motivating, fun way, so that was another finding after some continued digging.
						</p>
						<p>
							<h4>Social</h4>
							The majority of the more popular apps incorporate leaderboards and badges as what makes theirs "social". I felt like there should be more to this and what I would create will represent that, so score one for the "yes, let's do it because it doesn't exist" column.

			    </div>
			    <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			      <div class="panel-body">
						Usually the first people to hear one's idea are family and friends. This was no different in my case: after a little explaining and truly clarifying the difference between my proposed app and the thousands out there, everyone who I talked to said they liked and thought it was a good idea:
					 	<p><img src="images/jsFeedback.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Friend's Feedback">
							<small>2/26/14</small></p>

						Awesome!, I thought - if they like it, I must be well on my way. Next question was whether they would use it, and a few said they wouldn't, but that they still see its value and would recommend it to others they know who should and would use it. While hearing this initial feedback was nice, I didn't yet have the warm and fuzzy feelings of creating a non-functional prototype. I felt like I needed better validation and to understand more about tech entrepreneurship before I made any next moves.

			         I went on Amazon and typed in "entrepreneurship". After reading reviews and narrowing down my list, I decided The Lean Startup by Eric Ries would be my very first one and I'm glad it was! As soon as I cracked the book open on my kindle, I couldn't stop reading it even in the early hours of the morning.

						 I felt like I was learning so much and hearing a great story of a real-world situation, which made me that much more excited about entrepreneurship in general and about testing my idea with the real world to see if there's a market for it.

			<mark>Key Takeaways</mark>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>You versus them</strong> In a world with over seven billion people, there's a chance your idea
						already exists in some way, shape, or form. It's up to you to do your research on competitors, understand
						where you fit in, and determine what differentiates you from them. As a Carnegie Mellon entrepreneurship professor
						later asked me, "Will your idea be X times cheaper and / or Y times better?" To help with such a comparison,
						look at the helpful table <a href="http://www.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a> recommends creating:
						<img src="images/guyKawasaki.PNG" class="img-responsive" alt="Guy Kawasaki"/>
						<a href="mailto:theund3rdogblog@gmail.com">Send me an email</a>: I'll share mine and help you create
						yours.

          <p style="margin-top: 1em">It's been pretty exciting in my world ever since I decided to create an app on December 29, 2013. Coming up with an idea and the thought of actually implementing it to a point where it could potentially have a huge impact on millions of people has been immensely motivating and exciting; I guess that's what they call "passion".
</p>

		<p>
			This isn't the first time I've thought of an idea though. I actually have many in an "idea book" that I keep. Whether you've written yours down, I'm sure you, too, have a bunch. How many times did you ask yourself or a friend, "Wouldn't it be really useful if X existed?" or "Man, I could do Y much better and cheaper." I've had ideas before so what makes this time any different? A few reasons:
			<ul>
				<li>I no longer think only certain people can fit the profile of being an entrepreneur. </li>
				<li>I see this as my exciting window of opportunity to dive right in and let this be my first experience into the world of entrepreneurship.  </li>
				<li>I'm trying to solve this reoccurring, frustrating problem that I personally have and think others have, too. Why not me to try and solve it?</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			With the New Year having arrived, I was ready to pursue this full-steam ahead. I wondered where to go from there, however, and asked myself, “I guess I’m kind of, sort, just maybe an entrepreneur - now what?” With all of these thoughts running through my mind related to the app's functionality, design, user-base, and monetization, for example, I needed to get them out and write them down before going crazy. I remember saying to myself, "I wish there was an app to flesh out ideas in a structured manner!” I randomly opened the App Store and in the Recommended Productivity section, I found this great one called Elevatr. It provides a really simple and nice way of capturing one’s business idea (contact me if you’d like a Google Docs version).
		</p>

		<p>
			Over the next few days, I spent whatever free time I had on this, which included doing some initial research, further detailing out all my thoughts, and beginning to share the idea with some family and friends. I also knew that I needed to learn about entrepreneurism and wanted to buy a book. It also occurred to me that I didn't really have any entrepreneurs in my network, so how was I to change this? I'll cover all of this in my next post - talk to you then!
		</p>

		<p>
			<mark>Key Takeaways</mark>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Why not you?</strong> Entrepreneurs come in all shapes and sizes, colors, ages, and backgrounds, which means there
				aren't checklists out there for fitting this mold. There's also never a truly perfect time to pursue an idea of yours
				so ask yourself and think hard about what underlying factors is stopping you from getting started today.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p><strong>Get it out of your mind.</strong> It doesn't do you any good if you keep your thoughts bottled-up in your head. The simple act of writing it down, whether on paper or in some kind of note-taking app,
						<a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/how-writing-things-down-can-change-your-life.html">helps in many ways</a> and is actually a big first step.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
					<strong>Prepare yourself.</strong> Grab a book and / or read several articles of current and past entrepreneurs regardless if they succeeded or failed. This will help frame your mindset around what to expect when you pursue your idea and the things you can do to increase your chances of success.

				We all know that the overwhelming majority of entrepreneurs fail in their first endeavor: According to Bloomberg, 8 out of 10 companies fail within 18 months of opening for business.

				With so much great information out there, from books and trustworthy blogs to countless failure and success stories to learn from, this makes me wonder why the rate continues to be so high and what can be done about it.

			<p>
				As a first-time or “rookie" entrepreneur for ten months now, I've certainly experienced some of the challenges that could lead one away from achieving his or her goals. Because of all of this,
