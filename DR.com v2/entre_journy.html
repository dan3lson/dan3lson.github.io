Thought of the idea in the last few days of 2013, created a non-functional prototype and “tested” it with those from the education community from January 2014 to September 2014. After a positive reception, left corporate October 2014 to create the actual app.

Tried learning code on my own from October 2014 through March 2015, but wasn’t happy with how far I had gotten so I enrolled in the Boston bootcamp from March 2015 thru July 2015. In August 2015, Leksi was fully born.

October 2015 thru December 2015 was the first ever pilot with a middle school in downtown Manhattan.

December 2015 was when Leksi was incorporated and received its first check/customer.

January 2016 I went to Europe for almost two months and began freelancing in March 2016. Leksi, in the meantime, was mostly stagnant while I was away and even when I returned because I couldn’t decide if I wanted to go the consumer or institutional (aka school) route. Still bullshitted and didn’t decide until August 2016, which was when I finally recommitted to Leksi and decided schools was the route I wanted to first take it.

Since September 2016 thru February 2017, struggled getting other pilots and the attention of schools. Became more granular in which schools and neighborhoods I wanted to first target (i.e. charter schools in Harlem) in mid February 2017, which is when I thought of having a spelling bee competition.
