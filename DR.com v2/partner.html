            Regardless of which product you choose, we'll first talk about
            your goals, requirements, deadlines, etc. Then we'll create a
            customized plan that will guide us towards the completion of your
            exciting project.

                Whether it's a personal, business, or an organization site,
                saying bringing the world to your doorstep has never been
                easier.

                <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
                If you've never had a site before, I'll build you a new site
                that, among other factors,
                <ul>
                  <li>looks professional and clean</li>
                  <li>displays well on all devices, and</li>
                  <li>
                    has the essential search-engine-optimizations so that your
                    target audience can find you
                  </li>
                </ul>

              <p>
                <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
                For existing site owners that want a fresh new look, I'll
                enhance your site by
                <ul>
                  <li>making it look more appealing/modern</li>
                  <li>improving the user experience</li>
                  <li>adding new, relevant content</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                In both of the cases above, we'll first create user experience
                artifacts (e.g. detailed wireframes, low/high fidelity
                prototypes, and/or story boards) that show you what the site
                could look like before writing one line of code. After the site
                has been completed, we'll create a plan on how to maintain your
                site's freshness.

            meet deadlines nor complete my mobile app. In 8 weeks, Danelson has
            completed Plan B of my app idea underbudget and ahead of schedule.
            The communication and mutual trust has been top notch. I especially
            value the input and constructive criticism. Every change is
            thoroughly explained, and the agile development process in which we
            have engaged has made everything run so efficiently. I highly
            recommend him."

            which underwent a technology upheaval - which is how I met Danelson
            - when his team came to the rescue), I wouldn't want to work with
            anyone else on a tech support role. Our jobs at the bank provided
            strict deadlines and a "results or else" environment, which we were
            always able to meet due to our matching work ethic. Now, after
            having Danelson create my charity's website from scratch (mostly
            using his creative vision and native coding), I realized I could
            not hire anyone else for revisions - nobody matched his talent,
            communication, and work ethic. Excellent work with a great person

            designing my not-for profit's website. As a business owner,
            Danelson saved me so much time to handle other aspects of my

            Danelson. If you are considering Danelson to design your website,
