We believe in goal-driven business development (we want to understand whatâ€™s
valuable to clients before we begin), design-driven product development (we want
to know what a product will look like and how it will work before we start
building it) and test-driven software development (we want to ensure ongoing
quality and a successful post-launch existence for the applications we build).
