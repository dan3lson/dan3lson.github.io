How many times have you explained an idea/thought to someone and they didn’t quite get what you were saying? Or they didn’t remember what you excitedly told them just the other day? On the flip side, ever listened to someone be it one-on-one, in a small meeting, or large conference and thought “wtf are they saying?” or “hmmm seems interesting, but I’m probably going to forget this later”? Obviously I’ve had these thoughts, but I’ve also been in situations where I’ve wondered:
- How could I speak about my literacy app or the Harem Spelling Bee in a way that moves and spurs others to action?
- How could I teach my students and deliver lessons in a way that they’ll remember beyond the quiz (that they love so much)

Wanting to learn how to make my thoughts/ideas/messages stick in the minds of those to whom I’m speaking, I picked up Made to Stick by Chip Heath and Dan Heath. They came up with this SUCCESs framework for ensuring your ideas are sticky, meaningful, and moving.

In short,
- **S**imple
- **U**nexpected
- **C**redible
- **C**oncrete
- **E**motional
- **S**tory
- s (this letter actually doesn’t stand for anything; it just completes the word “success” and makes it easy to remember — go figure

Excerpts of the book; if you enjoy them, buy the book and make your ideas stick!
