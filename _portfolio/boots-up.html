description: A website for a not-for-profit organization serving military veterans nationwide.
quote: After working with Danelson at BNYMellon (in a separate department which underwent a technology upheaval - which is how I met Danelson - when his team came to the rescue), I wouldn't want to work with anyone else on a tech support role. Our jobs at the bank provided strict deadlines and a "results or else" environment, which we were always able to meet due to our matching work ethic. Now, after having Danelson create my charity's website from scratch (mostly using his creative vision and native coding), I realized I could not hire anyone else for revisions - nobody matched his talent, communication, and work ethic. Excellent work with a great person -- his work is absolutely worth every penny!
