quote: I've probably hired 10-20 web developers in my career thus far. I've never worked with someone as charismatic, professional, and hard-working as Danelson. I will certainly be hiring him in the future. Truly a pleasure working with you, great work, you exceeded my expectations and delivered us an excellent front-end for our mobile site. Thanks again
