<p>
	How many times have you explained an idea or thought to someone and they didn’t
	quite get what you were saying? Or they didn’t remember what you excitedly told
	them just the other day? On the flip side, ever listened to someone be it
	one-on-one, in a small meeting, or large conference and thought “wtf are they
	saying?” or “hmmm seems interesting, but I’m probably going to forget this
	later”?
</p>
<p>
	I’ve had these thoughts, but I’ve also been in situations where I’ve wondered:
	<ul>
		<li>
			How could I speak about my literacy app or the Harem Spelling Bee in a way
			that moves and spurs others to action?
		</li>
		<li>
			How could I teach my students and deliver lessons in a way that they’ll
			remember beyond the quiz (that they love so much)
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Wanting to learn how to make my thoughts/ideas/messages stick in the minds of
	those to whom I’m speaking, I picked up Made to Stick by Chip Heath and Dan
	Heath. They came up with this <i>SUCCESs</i> framework for ensuring your ideas
	are sticky, meaningful, and moving.
</p>
<p>
	Here's what the acronym stands for:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>S</b>imple
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>U</b>nexpected
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>C</b>redible
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>C</b>oncrete
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>E</b>motional
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>S</b>tory
	</li>
	<li>
		s (this letter actually doesn’t stand for anything; it just completes the
		word “success” and makes it easy to remember — go figure.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	After reading this book, I'm much more conscious of how to make my thoughts
	and ideas make more of an impact. I'll probably have follow-up blog posts
	where I actually complete the SUCCESs framework and share how it went.
