	Okay, this blog post title is a tad bit dramatic, but let
	me tell you about this reading challenge my partner Shelly and I got into, and
	the app that resulted from it. First, let me set the stage:
</p>
<p>
	One of my New Years resolutions for 2017 was
	to read one book a month. I hadn’t been reading as much as I wanted to, so
	that seemed pretty doable, but I fell short of that goal by six books. Fast
	forward to 2018, I set my resolutions for two books a month. Two — the nerve!
	I actually started out strong but then fell off late Spring and didn’t resume
	until June/July. When I got back in a groove, I was encouraging Shelly to get
	back into reading, which she loved doing and did when she was younger/just a
	few years back.
</p>
<p>
	After one of us finished a book (or any specially interesting point along the
	way), we’d give the other a recap and talk about it. We quickly found
	ourselves talking shit and, as we do with other affairs in our relationship,
	made a bet: whoever read the most books (i.e. words) by Thanksgiving only had
	to pay 20% of our next vacation. So yes, if you did the math correctly, the
	loser has to cover 80% of our next vacation!!
</p>
<p>
	Once we pinky-promised this bet and made it official, it’s like other facets
	of our relationship didn’t matter anymore :(*. Any free time we had, she would
	take out her Kindle Paperwhite and devoured books. I watched her read two
	books over a weekend and was like, “this is cool and all, buttttt...” I’d say
	something to her and would have to repeat myself because she was lost in
	Shonda Rhime’s Year of Yes or Crazy Rich Asians. This reading challenge was
	madness!
</p>
<p>
	Enough was enough!, lol. Unless we were both reading at the same time, like
	on a commute into the city or reading before bed, we decided to read on our
	own time and together-time was together-time.
</p>
<p>
	We initially kept track of the books we read via Google Sheets: title, author,
	number of pages, number of words, date started, and date finished. In one
	“overview” tab, we could see who was in the lead and how far back the other
	was one. This low-tech process met our needs at first, but we soon wanted more
	“features” and thought it would be cool to make an app out of this reading
	challenge.

	As a software developer, I loved the idea of encouraging others to read and
	competing against them intellectually so this was a perfect “passion project”
	or “breakable toy” to do. In two weeks working on the app here and there,
	Reading Madness was born and came alive. Though it's not the prettiest app yet
	and there's a ton that can be done with an app like this, it completely
	replaces the Google Sheets we used before and we’re excited to continue using
	and making it better.
