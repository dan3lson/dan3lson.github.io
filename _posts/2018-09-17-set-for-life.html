<p>
	I didn’t want to work for forty years in Corporate fighting to climb a ladder
	that millions of others are also on. I saw myself making bank and rising to
	the top on my own terms, but didn’t know how to do it. This book has certainly
	played its part in moving me closer and strengthening my plan and confidence
	to achieve my crazy and concrete goal of being able to retire in ten years, if
	I really wanted to. It’s a personal finance and wealth-building,
	financial-freedom-seeking kind of book that is delivered in three main parts:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Saving $10K-25K in one year so that you either can live off of it pursuing a
		business or house-hacking the purchase of a home)
	</li>
	<li>
		Saving $100K in years three to five
	</li>
	<li>
		Having financial freedom in three to X many years later (where "X" depends
		on your own discipline and situation) after completing parts one and two
		above
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The author Scott Trench also talks about optimal uses of your retirement
	account, investments, tracking your personal finance and time in more
	meaningful ways, and provides a daily, weekly, quarterly, and yearly template
	for developing strong habits towards achieving the goals in the three steps
	above.
</p>

<p>
	Learning more about a topic through different means will either give you new
	knowledge or strengthen whatever you already know about it. This book managed
	to do both for me and I hope it does the same for you. Let’s get them coins
	and live life on our own terms; life is too short...you should be living it
	however tf you want.
