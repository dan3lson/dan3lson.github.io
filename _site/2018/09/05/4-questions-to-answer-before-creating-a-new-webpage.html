	<h1>4 Questions to Answer Before Creating a New Webpage</h1>
	<div class="mb-1 text-muted">
		Sep 5, 2018
	</div>
	<p>
	I’m working with a school district to revamp their website and as excited as
	my client is for the project, they didn’t know what to do next after (happily)
	agreeing to work with each other. The first task we’re tackling is not yet the
	revamp itself, but creating two new webpages that are more pressing.
</p>
<p>
	To get going, I sent my client the four* questions below that will guide
	them in our early stages. These questions revolve around figuring out what
	the point is of creating a new page, how will we know it’s successful, and
	how can we deliver engaging content that’s actually relevant to their users.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		What goals do you have for each page? How do we measure its success? For
		example, one goal for the web development portion of my blog is to help
		other developers who may have had the same issue as me completing feature
		X. I'll deem it a success if website traffic increases/bounce rate remains
		low on that page, the number of email subscriptions for my mailing list
		increases, or one person makes a comment a la "thanks for the helpful
		post!".
	</li>
	<li>
		Let’s put ourselves in the position of our users like parents, students,
		or any kind of committee:
		<ul>
			<li>
				What information are they looking for?
			</li>
			<li>
				What questions do they have or what might they be confused about?
			</li>
			<li>
				How do they expect to navigate the website to arrive to this page that
				we’re creating for them?
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Do you have the content available for the new pages? If so, great!, but how
		can we make it even more relevant and concise for our users? How do you know
		it's what they're looking for in the first place?
	</li>
	<li>
		In thinking about the content from question #3, how can we break it down
		and deliver it in ways that’s just not solely focused on text? For example,
		what icons, images, videos, and/or social proofs can we include?
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Answering questions and going through exercises like these should get you
	moving in the right direction. If you’re wondering, yep, such questions can
	be asked when revamping a site, too.
</p>
<p>
	To your success,
	<br>
	Danelson

* Okay, fine, 4-ish questions
