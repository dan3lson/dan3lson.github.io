	Okay, this blog post title is a tad bit dramatic, but let
	me tell you about this reading challenge my partner Shelly and I got into, and
	the app that resulted from it. First, let me set the stage:
</p>
<p>
	One of my New Years resolutions for 2017 was to read one book a month. I
	hadn’t been reading as much as I wanted to, so that seemed pretty doable. The
	results? I fell short of that goal by six books. Fast forward to 2018, I set
	my resolutions for two books a month. Two &emdash; the nerve!
	I actually started out strong, but then fell off late Spring and didn’t resume
	until June. When I got back in a groove, I started to encourage Shelly to get
	back into reading, which she loved doing and did often just a few years back.
</p>
<p>
	When one of us finished a book (or read any interesting point along the
	way), we’d give a recap and talk about it. We quickly found ourselves talking
	shit about who was reading more and, as we do with other affairs in our
	relationship, we made a bet: whoever reads the most books (i.e. words) by
	Thanksgiving 2018 only had to pay 20% of our next vacation. If you did the
	math correctly, the loser has to cover 80% of our next vacation!!
</p>
<p>
	Once we pinky-promised this bet and made it official, it’s like other facets
	of our relationship didn’t matter anymore :(*. Any free time we had, she would
	take out her Kindle Paperwhite and devoured books. I watched her read two
	books over a weekend and was like, “this is cool and all, buttttt...” I’d say
	something to her and would have to repeat myself because she was lost in
	Shonda Rhime’s Year of Yes or Kevin Kwan's Crazy Rich Asians. What started out
	as a simple, light-hearted reading challenge suddenly turned into madness!
</p>
<p>
	Enough was enough!, lol. Unless we were both reading at the same time, like
	on a commute into the city or reading before knocking out at night, we decided
	to read on our own time (plenty of time to read at least 30-60 min a day) and
	couple-time was couple-time.
</p>
<p>
	We initially kept track of the books we read via Google Sheets: title, author,
	number of pages, number of words, date started, and date finished (images
	below). In the “overview” tab, we could see who was in the lead and how far
	back the other one was. This low-tech process met our needs at first, but we
	soon wanted more “features” and thought it would be cool to make an app out of
	this reading challenge.

	<a href="/services/web-development.html" title="Learn more about my web deve services">As a software developer</a>,
	I love the idea of encouraging others to read and
	competing against them in this way so this became a perfect “passion project”
	or “breakable toy” to create. In two weeks working on the app here and there,
	Reading Madness was born and came alive. Though it's not the prettiest app yet
	and there's a ton that can be done with an app like this, it completely
	replaces the Google Sheets we used before and we’re excited to continue using
	and making it better. See what it looks like below!
