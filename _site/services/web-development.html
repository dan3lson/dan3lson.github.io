        I love creating apps and working with clients to make their ideas a
        reality.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        I remember delivering my first few websites to my clients &mdash; I was
        excited to work with them and to improve my just-learned web design
        skills. My clients, on the other hand, were very happy and confident
        to know they were about to get an A+ on their website projects.
        We were sophomores in high school and I charged around $10 per project
        :).
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Ever since then, my clients and the work I've completed for them has
        been much more diverse. What has always remained the same though is me
        communicating well throughout our partnership, delivering quality work,
        and wanting my client's projects to succeed as much as they do.

Every change is thoroughly explained, and the agile development process in which we have engaged has made everything run so efficiently. I highly recommend him.</span>

Our jobs at the bank provided strict deadlines and a "results or else" environment, which we were always able to meet due to our matching work ethic. Now, after having Danelson create my charity's website from scratch (mostly using his creative vision and native coding), I realized I could not hire anyone else for revisions - nobody matched his talent, communication, and work ethic. Excellent work with a great person -- his work is absolutely worth every penny!</span>

                  Leksi helps students learn and use new vocabulary. Students are walked through multiple activities that help build and reinforce connections in the brain for each new word. The process brings them from basic activities, such as spelling vocabulary, to more complicated exercises such as composing a short story or poem.

                  The Leksi Harlem Spelling Bee is about more than remembering a few words. It’s a challenge that teaches students they can do anything if they’re willing to set their mind to it. And if they can study hard enough to become Finalists at the Main Event, then there is nothing out of their reach.
