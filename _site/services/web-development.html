              Danelson was a fantastic member of our team, and was one of our superstar teachers. He worked with Generation Code across multiple sites and partners, and received outstanding feedback from all of them. He was always responsive and adaptable to last-minute changes, which is incredibly important in a start-up type of environment.

              Danelson rescued my idea as my previous team of developers did not meet deadlines nor complete my mobile app. In 8 weeks, Danelson has completed Plan B of my app idea underbudget and ahead of schedule. The communication and mutual trust has been top notch. I especially value the input and constructive criticism. Every change is thoroughly explained, and the agile development process in which we have engaged has made everything run so efficiently. I highly recommend him.

              I've probably hired 10-20 web developers in my career thus far. I've never worked with someone as charismatic, professional, and hard-working as Danelson. I will certainly be hiring him in the future. Truly a pleasure working with you, great work, you exceeded my expectations and delivered us an excellent front-end for our mobile site. Thanks again

              What I liked most about Danelson's web design service was the high-quality, prompt & businesslike approach he took while designing my not-for profit's website. As a business owner, Danelson saved me so much time to handle other aspects of my business and I could not be more pleased with my experience with Danelson. If you are considering Danelson to design your website, I strongly recommend him. He is always willing to go beyond to make sure you are 100% satisfied.

              My project had stayed behind due to lack of expertise and experience by previous freelancers in dealing with some of the challenges it presented.  Danelson was able to solve those issues and at the same to provide qualitative work and valuable feedback when needed.  I would recommend Danelson any day of the week and twice on Sunday :)
