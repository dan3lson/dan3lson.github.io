         <h2>All about my school</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Naviah. I'm 10 years old. I am in 5th grade. I'm going to be writing about my life meaning that I'm going to wite about my family trips, school trips my school years and what my family and I do together.My schools name is Bronx
            Lighthouse Charter School. I have one brother,Ethan, my brother is 8 years old. He is in 3rd grade. I have a mom her name is Renita. I have one father his name is Freddy.Now to talk about my school. I have been in Bronx Lighthouse Charter School
            ever sence I was in Kindergarten. My Kindergarten teacher is Ms.Jones. She was so nice I never knew that I failed a test until my friend told me that I failed but I still passed. I really didn't went on any trips. My first grade teachers name is Ms.Lemon. She was nice. at the
            end of the school year she asked my mom if she would like for me to skip 3rd grade, but she said no because if I miss something and I get tested in 4th grade and I don't know I could fail 4th grade instead of passing. We went on 1 trip we went on a trip to the park across the street like a couple of times. My 2nd grade teacher
            was the same teacher from first grade teacher. She was still nice then the next year I was sad because she left the school, so far she is my first favorite teacher. My 3rd grade teacher is still in the school her name is Ms.Laracuente. She
            was so mean when it was parent teacher conference she lied and said that I stole a EXPO marker I didn't do my friend did that and she it with her own eyes. She was a rode little bratt. We went to this theater that you see the actors perform on stage I for got what it's called but we saw the wizard of oz and we went there a couple of times to see different ones and see how it is different in each part of the wizard of oz.There was many different ways it was different and each part is amazing and also it got interesting every time. My 4th grade teachers name is Ms.Teets. She was nice to
            me and my good friends like Michelle, Stephanie, sometimes Mia, and sofia because we are really good friends, but my best friends forever is Michelle and Mia. Me and Michelle met in 4th grade the day we met we knew that we were going to be
            good friends. By then me and Mia really didn't talk to each other for a while. We went to six flags, the science museum, the bronx zoo, this acuarium, Ripleys believe it or not, and a lot more. Now we are in Fith Grade the grade that i am in right now. My teacher is Ms.Magiraga. She is really nice, she likes to throw partys and selabrate a lot of things. We went on one trip to medeviel times we was on a black and white team and 4th grade and Ms.James was in red and guess what black and white won the compition. It was fun now we have a lot more trips we are going to coney island to this acuarium, the bronx zoo, the science museum again but this time we are going inside the park.

    <h2 id="My-Family">All about my family</h2>
        <p>Now on to what I have been doing with my family for the past several years I have been with them. I've been in many places with my family like Demenicain Republic, Fordia, New Mexico, kidedicet, and so many other places. I have been to splish splash while I was at DR I went to this mini pool with a big slid and also had a mini slid and a hot tube. I t was really hot when i went there I went the pool plenty of times and I loved it and we also went to the beach and the beach was so clean you could eveen see through the water and when I was there me, my brother, my dad, and a couple of my cousins too went to the deep side of the beach and I went on my cousins back because I couldn't reach the floor so while I was on her back one of those pufer fishes was near me and it went poff and it touched and it stinged. It hurted a little bit but not a lot. When I was in kidedicet in the fall or winter I went to this inside waterpark and I went in the hot tube that hot tube was really hot. When I went to florida it was hot and we had this pool behind our hotel we stayed there like about 2 weeks then we came back to New York. When I went to New Mexico I had fun we went to this muesum to see the dinosors bones and  saw how the dinosors died. We also went to pools. It was pretty hot and it felt good to be in the pool so my body can cool down.<p/>
