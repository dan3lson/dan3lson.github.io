              You really have made me believe that I have the power to do
              anything that I set my mind to and you are the best role model I

              I would like to thank you for all your help and support that you
              have given me since the day we met. You have made me open up and
              express my concerns with great comfort.  It's been a while since
              I was able to speak up about my problems with anyone. I can't
              thank you enough, not only for the morale support, but also for
              having faith in me. I'm proud to have you as an advisor.

              Now that I’m in high school, I noticed that I worry less about
              what others think of me, I'm more confident than I ever was in
              middle school, and I also noticed that I'm more quick to reject
              negativity.

              Mya is currently in the 7th grade and has been transitioning
              from a child to a teenager. This transition is not an easy one,
              and I found myself looking for a program/service that can help
              assist her father and I in making sure she develops into a
              productive young lady, student and all around well-rounded person.
              Success Worthy has been a blessing to our family. I have seen such
              a change in Mya. Since joining, Mya has improved in school.
              She has also displayed a confidence in herself that wasn’t there
              previously. I couldn’t thank her life coach enough for the
              changes I’ve seen thus far and look forward to more positive
              progression.
