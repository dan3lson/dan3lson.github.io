      <h1>Parents and Students</h1>
      <p>
        Dear parents and students, my name is Andreina Idalia Rosa, J.D. and I
        am a strong advocate for academic, personal and professional growth and
        development. I love empowering young people by not just simply
        advocating for their best interests, but by giving them the tools to
        learn how to advocate for themselves.
      </p>
      <h2>Students</h2>
      <p>
        My experience as a student from elementary school through law school
        inspired me to wake up every morning with confidence, purpose, and the
        power to believe that despite my adversities, I can still become
        anything I aspire to be in life. You can too. Let’s stop saying no to
        ourselves before even applying for that competitive school, internship,
        or scholarship, deterring us from at least applying for new
        opportunities. Or, even if we do apply, just because an opportunity
        doesn’t work out as planned, does not mean we give up on ourselves. When
        someone says no and closes a door on us, that is when we need ourselves
        the most to say yes.
        <b>You are worthy</b> of having big dreams for yourself.
        <b>You are worthy</b>
        of the process it takes to accomplish those dreams.
        <b>You are worthy</b>
        of living the life you want to design for yourself. But
        first, you must put yourself out there and put yourself in uncomfortable
        situations to welcome challenges and accept growth. By doing so, you
        will learn to understand just how powerful you really are and the impact
        you can have on others and on yourself. Success Worthy believes in you.
      </p>
      <h2>Parents</h2>
      <p>
        We all want what’s best for our children and sometimes we may not always
        have the resources, knowledge, or time to substantially dedicate
        ourselves to help our children become great students and working
        professionals the way we would like to. Success Worthy provides
        additional services outside of the classroom to meet the high demand of
        a school’s academic or college counselor who may be overworked and
        thus, may not provide the individualized support you desire for your
        child. Success Worthy works with our clients outside of school hours,
        including weekends to meet important deadlines whether it’s to help
        your child prepare for an interview for an internship or whether it’s
        reviewing and editing a personal statement for college or law school
        admissions. We are here to guide your children during all transitions
        from elementary school to college and beyond and we believe the most
        effective recipe for success is to create measurable goals and a plan
        that will reflect your child’s strengths, interests, and passions. Here
        at Success Worthy, we will follow-up with your child’s action plan to
        ensure completion of academic, personal, and career goals. We are here
        to help so that you can enjoy this time raising your children to be the
        best version of themselves.
